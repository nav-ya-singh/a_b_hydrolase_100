# a_b_hydrolase_100

This script executes the following pipeline:

1. Pass in a pdb id txt file (throught the bash command line), download all the cif files from their pdb ids

2. Count the number of amino acids in unique chains per cif file, and output plots of the amino acid counts and percentages for all the pdbs in the text file.
